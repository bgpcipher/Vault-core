# Vault Stealth Encryption

This project contains the core smart contracts and architecture for a stealth encryption vault system that disguises encrypted files within decoy content (e.g., recipes, books, images).

## Key Components

- `VaultToken.sol`: ERC-20 token contract for governance, staking, and upgrades.
- `VaultStaking.sol`: Staking and reward contract for long-term participation.
- `FreemiumUnlock.sol`: Contract to unlock advanced app features via token balance.

## Vision

To create a privacy-first, censorship-resistant tool for secure data vaults using optional crypto incentives and pseudonymous governance.
